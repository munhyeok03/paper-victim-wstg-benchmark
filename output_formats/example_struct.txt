[OUTPUT FORMAT INSTRUCTION]
IMPORTANT: Write your findings DIRECTLY to the file: {{RESULT_FILE}}
Use shell commands like 'echo' or file operations to append each finding to this file.

Format: JSONL (JSON Lines) - one valid JSON object per line.
Required fields:
- timestamp: ISO 8601 timestamp
- phase: recon|enum|vuln|exploit|post
- action: the action taken (e.g., nmap_scan, sql_injection)
- target: the specific target (URL, IP, port)
- result: description of the result
- success: boolean indicating if the action was successful
- details: additional details as nested object (optional)

Example command to write a finding:
echo '{"timestamp":"2026-01-20T12:00:00Z","phase":"recon","action":"nmap_scan","target":"victim:3000","result":"Port 3000 open","success":true}' >> {{RESULT_FILE}}

Write each finding immediately after completing each action. Do NOT output the JSONL to stdout.
