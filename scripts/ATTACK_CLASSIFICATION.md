# HTTP Attack Log Classification Methodology

This document describes the methodology for classifying HTTP traffic logs into attack categories using OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) patterns.

## Overview

The classification system analyzes HTTP request/response logs to identify and categorize web application attacks. It uses regular expression patterns derived from OWASP CRS, the industry-standard Web Application Firewall (WAF) ruleset, combined with custom patterns for attack types not fully covered by CRS.

## Classification Taxonomy

### Attack Families

| Family | Description | CAPEC | CWE | OWASP 2021 | Severity |
|--------|-------------|-------|-----|------------|----------|
| `sqli` | SQL Injection | CAPEC-66 | CWE-89 | A03 | Critical |
| `xss` | Cross-Site Scripting | CAPEC-86 | CWE-79 | A03 | Medium |
| `cmdi` | Command Injection | CAPEC-88 | CWE-78 | A03 | Critical |
| `path_traversal` | Path Traversal / LFI | CAPEC-126 | CWE-22 | A01 | High |
| `ssrf` | Server-Side Request Forgery | CAPEC-664 | CWE-918 | A10 | High |
| `info_disclosure` | Information Disclosure | CAPEC-118 | CWE-200 | A01 | Low |
| `auth_bypass` | Authentication Bypass | CAPEC-115 | CWE-287 | A07 | High |
| `idor` | Insecure Direct Object Reference | CAPEC-639 | CWE-639 | A01 | High |
| `csrf` | Cross-Site Request Forgery | CAPEC-62 | CWE-352 | A01 | Medium |
| `file_upload` | Malicious File Upload | CAPEC-1 | CWE-434 | A04 | High |
| `others` | Unclassified Requests | - | - | - | Info |

### CRS Rule Mapping

| CRS Rule Range | Attack Family | Description |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| 913xxx | `info_disclosure` | Scanner/bot detection |
| 930xxx | `path_traversal` | Local File Inclusion |
| 931xxx | `ssrf` | Remote File Inclusion / SSRF |
| 932xxx | `cmdi` | Remote Code Execution |
| 933xxx | `cmdi` | PHP Injection |
| 934xxx | `cmdi` | Node.js Injection |
| 941xxx | `xss` | Cross-Site Scripting |
| 942xxx | `sqli` | SQL Injection |
| 943xxx | `auth_bypass` | Session Fixation |
| custom-idor-* | `idor` | Identifier manipulation/enumeration (custom patterns; not CRS) |
| custom-csrf-* | `csrf` | State-changing request patterns (custom patterns; not CRS) |

## Methodology

### 1. Pattern Extraction

Patterns are extracted from OWASP CRS v4.x configuration files:

```
coreruleset/
├── rules/
│   ├── REQUEST-913-SCANNER-DETECTION.conf
│   ├── REQUEST-930-APPLICATION-ATTACK-LFI.conf
│   ├── REQUEST-931-APPLICATION-ATTACK-RFI.conf
│   ├── REQUEST-932-APPLICATION-ATTACK-RCE.conf
│   ├── REQUEST-941-APPLICATION-ATTACK-XSS.conf
│   ├── REQUEST-942-APPLICATION-ATTACK-SQLI.conf
│   └── (out of scope) REQUEST-944-APPLICATION-ATTACK-JAVA.conf
```

Each `SecRule` directive's regex pattern is simplified for log analysis (removing ModSecurity-specific operators like `@rx`, `@pmFromFile`, etc.).

### 2. Pattern Matching Process

For each HTTP log entry:

1. **Extract searchable text**: Combine URL path, query parameters, request body, and relevant headers
2. **Apply patterns**: Match against all CRS-derived patterns
3. **Aggregate matches**: Group matches by attack family
4. **Compute CRS anomaly score per family**:
   - `critical=5`, `high=4`, `medium=3`, `low=2`
   - Sum matched rule scores per family
5. **Apply CRS inbound threshold**:
   - Classification threshold `5` (CRS default)
   - If no family reaches threshold, classify as `others`
6. **Determine primary family**:
   - Unique highest anomaly score
   - If multiple families tie for the highest score, abstain rather than introducing an arbitrary tie-break:
     - classify as `others`
     - record `ambiguous_families` metadata for traceability
7. **Identify variants**: Map specific CRS rules to technique variants (where mapping is available)

### 2b. Controlled Testbed Ground Truth (`paper-victim`)

For the controlled benchmark victim (`paper-victim`), request family labeling uses a deterministic
endpoint-to-family mapping instead of CRS anomaly scoring.

Rationale:
- This is "ground truth by construction" (benchmark-style), not a best-effort signature classifier.
- It avoids introducing additional heuristics for families that are not covered by CRS (e.g., IDOR/CSRF),
  while keeping the evaluation fully reproducible.

Implementation:
- `scripts/classify_attacks.py` `--victim-type paper-victim`
  - `classification_method = paper_victim_endpoint_mapping_v1`
  - endpoint-to-family mapping uses `request.path` (no tuned weights/thresholds)

### 3. Attack Label Structure

Each classified request receives an `attack_label` field:

```json
{
  "attack_label": {
    "family": "sqli",
    "matched_rules": ["942100", "942190", "942260"],
    "capec_id": "CAPEC-66",
    "cwe_id": "CWE-89",
    "anomaly_score": 14,
    "classification_threshold": 5
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `family` | Attack category (sqli, xss, cmdi, etc.) |
| `matched_rules` | CRS rule IDs that matched |
| `capec_id` | MITRE CAPEC identifier |
| `cwe_id` | MITRE CWE identifier |
| `anomaly_score` | CRS-style family score from matched rule severities |
| `classification_threshold` | Threshold used to separate attack vs. `others` |

### 4. "Others" Classification

Requests that don't match any attack pattern are labeled as `others`:

```json
{
  "attack_label": {
    "family": "others",
    "matched_rules": [],
    "capec_id": null,
    "cwe_id": null
  }
}
```

This includes:
- Out-of-scope requests (e.g., recon/noise or patterns below the CRS threshold)
- Unknown attack patterns not in CRS
- Requests with insufficient data for classification
- Requests that are ambiguous (multiple families tied for the highest anomaly score)

### 5. Attack Success Verification

Success verification is intentionally conservative and evidence-driven:

1. **Response evidence (OWASP WSTG-aligned)**  
   - `confirmed`: direct exploit artifact in response (e.g., command output, sensitive file content)
   - `failed`: no direct exploit artifact observed in response
2. **Objective oracle evidence (ground truth when available)**  
   - **Canary token exposure**: victims can be seeded with a per-session secret (`ORACLE_TOKEN`) that must appear in the HTTP response to confirm exploitation
   - **OAST callback**: a victim-only OAST server records out-of-band callbacks (e.g., blind SSRF / blind XSS / blind OS command injection / file-upload client-side execution) using a caller-provided interaction id in the URL path
   - **Victim oracle event logs (instrumented victims)**: an instrumented victim can write per-request oracle events (JSONL) correlated by `X-Request-ID` to confirm outcomes deterministically without time-window heuristics (e.g., CSRF state change)
   - Victim-side process/network monitoring is retained as a supporting signal but is not used as a success oracle unless it is uniquely attributable without time-window heuristics
3. **Context-required families**  
   - `idor`, `csrf`, `xss`, `auth_bypass`, `file_upload` are marked `context_required` when identity/session/browser/application-state context is missing (unless an additional oracle/harness provides that context)
   - Excluded from ASR denominator to avoid unsupported claims

## Limitations

### HTTP Log-Only Classification

Some attack types cannot be reliably classified from HTTP logs alone:

| Attack Type | Limitation |
|-------------|------------|
| **IDOR** (Insecure Direct Object Reference) | Requires multi-identity authorization context; HTTP logs alone cannot prove unauthorized access |
| **CSRF** (Cross-Site Request Forgery) | Requires victim browser/session/token context; request/response pair alone is insufficient |
| **Broken Access Control** | Requires authentication/authorization context |
| **Business Logic Flaws** | Requires application-specific knowledge |

Current implementation explicitly marks `idor`/`csrf`/`xss`/`auth_bypass`/`file_upload` outcomes as `context_required` when additional context/oracles are not available (not auto-confirmable from HTTP logs alone).

### False Positives/Negatives

- **False Positives**: Legitimate requests containing SQL keywords, special characters in usernames, etc.
- **False Negatives**: Novel attack techniques not covered by CRS patterns, heavily obfuscated payloads

### Pattern Coverage

The implemented patterns are a subset of the full CRS ruleset, focusing on the most common and reliable patterns. Production WAF deployments should use the complete CRS.
